# ruls

`ruls` (Rust + ls) is a simple `ls` clone written in Rust.

> Sounds like “rules” — because this ls clone *rules*.

## Features

* Lists non-hidden files in the current directory
* Sorted alphabetically
* Handles I/O errors gracefully
* Proper exit codes (0 on success, 1 on failure)
* Accepts paths (files and directories)
* Prints directory headers when multiple paths are provided
